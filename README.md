Conceptual, mathematical, and engineering scaffolding for DNA data storage as an information substrate
# The Discovery of DNA Data Storage

This repository implements the `A → source → ki → system-logos → script` architecture for DNA data storage as an information substrate. It couples narrative, formal constraints, and executable tooling.

- `source/` – raw notes, references, historical fragments.
- `ki/` – formal layer (constraints, channel models, code constructions).
- `system-logos/` – high-order narrative (Discovery text, future keynotes/briefs).
- `script/` – encoding/decoding pipelines and simulators.

- GitHub mirror: https://github.com/Saysno33/dna-data-storage-logos


## Scope

- Formal narrative of the discovery and conceptual shift.
- Encoding/decoding pipelines (bits → bases → bits).
- Notes on error-correcting codes, constrained coding, and oligo design.
- Links to experimental and simulation tools for DNA data storage workflows.
