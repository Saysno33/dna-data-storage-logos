# dna-data-storage-logos
Conceptual, mathematical, and engineering scaffolding for DNA data storage as an information substrate
# The Discovery of DNA Data Storage

A technical and conceptual project treating DNA not as a metaphorical storage medium, but as a literal, base-4 digital substrate with civilizational-scale archival potential.

## Scope

- Formal narrative of the discovery and conceptual shift.
- Encoding/decoding pipelines (bits → bases → bits).
- Notes on error-correcting codes, constrained coding, and oligo design.
- Links to experimental and simulation tools for DNA data storage workflows.

## OSF Project
